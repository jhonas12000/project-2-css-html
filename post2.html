                <blockquote>There is literally zero surprise here as LeBron has dominated this era of 
                    basketball and will go down as one of the two greatest players to every 
                    grace a basketball court.</blockquote>  James has been in the league for 18 years and 
                has racked up 4 MVP awards and 4 NBA titles. LeBron is a very special 
                talent on the court, and he loves to show off his luxury lifestyle off of it.
        
                James has had 3 major houses during his time in the league and we will start
                with his first naturally, the 18 year old James purchased a very large plot
                of land in Akron that would soon transform into a 30,000 square foot mansion 
                that has 19 rooms, 6 bedrooms, a recording studio, a bowling alley, an on
                line casino, an aquarium, a barbershop and a 2-story walk in closet. 
                That last line may be the most luxurious line I have ever read, but wait,
                there is more. James also purchased a house in his time with the Miami Heat
                for $13.4 million and most recently bought a $21 million house in California.
                On top of all this, LeBron has a car collection that would make your jaw 
                drop, and is going to keep racking up money from his endorsements for the 
                rest of his life. LeBron James and his outrageous sums of money have
                landed him the most luxurious lifestyle in the NBA.
