            <p>Roger Cumberbtch completes his series of pieces on the best basketball 
                players or all-time, and ends in the right way, with the greatest player 
                of them all, Michael Jordan.

            <h3>Opening Tip</h3>
            <p>Greatness is defined as the quality of being great in size, skill,
                achievement, or power. In basketball, fans and media alike tend to 
                equate greatness with <b>championships</b>.  

                This obviously is a flawed method for evaluating the best talent 
                to ever grace an NBA court.  Shaq was the largest and most physically
                dominant player, yet he is not even the greatest center of all time. 
                <spin style="font-style: italic;"><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James'> Lebron James</a></spin> has competed in <u>10 NBA Finals</u>, but only won 4. 
                <spin style="font-style: italic;"><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell'>Bill Russell won 11 titles as a player, and 2 more as a coach.</a> </spin> 
                

                All of these players could be named as the greatest of all time, but 
                we have reserved the coronation for one player.  

                There exists only one player in history with; <u>6 NBA Finals appearances</u>,
                a record of 6-0 in the Finals, winning three in a row twice.  No player 
                has had, or ever will have, the overall impact globally on the sport of 
                basketball the way he did.  Based solely on statistics, this could be a 
                debate until the end of time, but whatever, Michael Jordan is the best 
                of The 10 Greatest Players In NBA History.
